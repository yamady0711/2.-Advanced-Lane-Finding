Project}\label{advanced-lane-finding-project}}

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients
  given a set of chessboard images.
\item
  Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
\item
  Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary
  image.
\item
  Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image (``birds-eye
  view'').
\item
  Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
\item
  Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect
  to center.
\item
  Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
\item
  Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation
  of lane curvature and vehicle position.
\end{itemize}

The code for this step is contained in the \#2 code cells of the Jupyter
notebook \texttt{t-yamada.ipynb}.

I start by preparing ``object points'', which will be the (x, y, z)
coordinates of the chessboard corners in real world. Here I am assuming
the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object
points are the same for each calibration image. Thus, \texttt{objp} is
just a replicated array of coordinates, and \texttt{objpoints} will be
appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all
chessboard corners in a test image by using
\texttt{cv2.findChessboardCorners()}. \texttt{imgpoints},which are
chessboard corners in 2d image, will be appended with the (x, y) pixel
position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful
chessboard detection.

To show the result of finding chessboard corners clearly, I used
\texttt{plt.subplots} to show all the corners' captured chessboard
images. Note: Some of the chessboard images don't appear because in some
cases, \texttt{cv2.findChessboardCorners} was not able to detect the
requested number of internal corners.

{[}output\_images/output\_4\_0.png{]}

.

I then used the output \texttt{objpoints} and \texttt{imgpoints} to
compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the
\texttt{cv2.calibrateCamera()} function. I applied this distortion
correction to the test image using the \texttt{cv2.undistort()} function
and obtained the result attached below.

I tried sobel gradients and HSL color channel by tweaking lower and
higher thresholds.

The codes and result images are in the code cell from \#6 to \#11 the
Jupyter notebook.

Below is an example of HLS S-channel.

The code for perspective transform is in the code cell \#12 in the
Jupyter notebook.

The unwarp() function takes as inputs an gray image (\texttt{gray}),
source (\texttt{src}) and destination (\texttt{dst}) points.

I assumed that the camera position remain constant and that the road in
the videos will remain relatively flat.

So I selected source and destination points considering straight\_lines
image in \texttt{test\_images} folder for reference.

The images below are results of the perspective transform.

After examining, I chose to use the condition as below.

(Sobel Magnitude and Sobel Direction) OR HLS S-channel Threshold OR HLS
L-channel Threshold

The below images are the transition from original image.

The left is original image, the middle is undistorted and thresholded
through above conditions, the right is perspective transformed one.

polynomial?}\label{describe-how-and-identify-where-in-your-code-you-identified-lane-line-pixels-and-fit-their-positions-with-a-polynomial}}

The functions \texttt{sliding\_window\_polyfit} and
\texttt{polyfit\_using\_prev\_fit}, which identify lane lines and fit a
second order polynomial to both right and left lane lines, are codel
cell \#14 \& \#17 in the Jupyter notebook.

\texttt{sliding\_window\_polyfit} uses a histogram of lower half of the
image, and find the bottom-most x position of the left and right lane.
In the original function in the lesson, these locations were identified
from the local maximum of the left and right half of the histogram, but
in below implementation I changed ``half'' to ``quarter'' of the
histogram just left and right of the midpoint,which resulted in better
detection after several trials.

Pixels in each lane line are identified in the sliding windows and the
\texttt{np.polyfit()} function finds a second order polynomial to each
set of pixels. The image below demonstrates how this process works:

{[}output\_images/output\_15\_1.png{]}

.

Note: By seeing the histgram of the image, we can see that using quarter
window is avoiding the noisy pixels in the very left, compared to using
half windows.

    The \texttt{polyfit\_using\_prev\_fit} function performs basically the
same task, but it is a bit easier search process by comparing a previous
fit and only searching for lane pixels within a certain range of that
fit. The image below demonstrates this - the green area is the range
from the previous fit, and the yellow lines and red and blue pixels are
from the current image:

The codes of calculation is in the code cell \#18.

\texttt{y\_meters\_per\_pixel} and \texttt{x\_meters\_per\_pixel} are
the factors used for converting from pixels to meters.

The radius of curvature is based upon the
website(https://www.intmath.com/applications-differentiation/8-radius-curvature.php).

Position of the vehicle is considered as the center of the image, so
distance from the mid-point of detected left and right lane line is
``the position of the vehicle with respect to center''.

This step is in the code cells \#19 and \#20.

By using the inverse perspective matrix \texttt{Minv} which was derived
in the ``Perspective transform'' section, left and right lane lines and
area between them are drwawn on the original image with
\texttt{cv2.warpPerspective()}. The image below is an example of the
results:

The main problem I had struggled was to identify the best/optimal color
transform and gradients. Sudden lighting change are very weak for my
setting this time.

In this project, I utilzed narrowing the window for polyfitting section
to avoid picking up noise pixels. But I am not satisfied with this since
this approach is not globally optimal. To make this algorithm more
robust, some sort of smoothing factor should be included in the lane
detection function.
